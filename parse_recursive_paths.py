"""
This script parses a string representation of a filesystem structure into a tree-like directory structure.

The 'Node' class represents a node in this tree, which can be either a file or a folder. Files cannot have 
children, while folders can.

The 'DirectoryTree' class contains a single root folder from which all other files/folders can be reached.
The 'parse_tree_to_filesystem' function uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to convert a string representation of a 
directory tree into a 'DirectoryTree' object. This object can then be manipulated programmatically as needed,
with methods such as 'print_paths' available for convenience.

Please note: Recursive models currently work if they are wrapped by a non-recursive one. This is why we are
passing a 'DirectoryTree' (which contains a single 'Node') as the function call, not a 'Node' directly. This
is due to a limitation in how Pydantic generates schemas for recursive objects, which creates 
'dict_keys(['$ref', 'definitions'])'. Instead of writing a resolver for such references, we can simply wrap the 
recursive class in a non-recursive one so the function_call class never has a cyclic reference.

Example usage:
>>> root = parse_tree_to_filesystem(
...     '''
...     root
...     ├── folder1
...     │   ├── file1.txt
...     │   └── file2.txt
...     └── folder2
...         ├── file3.txt
...         └── subfolder1
...             └── file4.txt
...     '''
... )
>>> root.print_paths()
# Expected output:
# >>> root                                  NodeType.FOLDER
# >>> root/folder1                          NodeType.FOLDER
# >>> root/folder1/file1.txt                NodeType.FILE
# >>> root/folder1/file2.txt                NodeType.FILE
# >>> root/folder2                          NodeType.FOLDER
# >>> root/folder2/file3.txt                NodeType.FILE
# >>> root/folder2/subfolder1               NodeType.FOLDER
# >>> root/folder2/subfolder1/file4.txt     NodeType.FILE
